# Script Weaver

Script Weaver is a Python-based GUI application designed to create, edit, manage, and execute scripts by "weaving" together modular components. It supports languages like Python, Bash, and PowerShell, allowing users to build and run custom workflows efficiently. With features like in-app editing, grouping, tagging, and security options, it's perfect for developers, system administrators, and automation enthusiasts. This version is built and tested on the latest version of macOS 15.5, with support for other platforms in development.

Hint: Keep an eye out for possible Easter eggs, like references to classic movies‚Äîlet the discovery be part of the fun!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Script Weaver uses a configuration file to define modules and workflows, following this process:

1. **Configuration Parsing**: Loads the workflow configuration to identify modules, groups, tags, and execution details.
2. **Weaving Process**: Combines scripts into executable wrappers, managing flow, variables, and dependencies like sudo requirements.
3. **Editing and Management**: Use the GUI to edit scripts, create groups, add tags, link installs/uninstalls, and search.
4. **Security and Confirmation**: Applies built-in security checks, prompts for sudo if needed, and shows confirmation dialogs.
5. **Execution**: Runs the woven script or group, monitoring progress and capturing logs with included progress bars.
6. **Logging**: Records outcomes, errors, and metrics in logs, with hover descriptions and links available in the GUI.
7. **Cleanup**: Manages temporary files and resets the environment.

The app runs in a Python virtual environment, leveraging a GUI for interactive management, with dark theme and customization options accessible via settings.
